## Porting Assistant for .NET
Porting Assistant for .NET is an analysis tool that scans .NET Framework applications and generates a .NET Core compatibility assessment, helping customers port their applications to Linux faster.

Porting Assistant for .NET quickly scans .NET Framework applications to identify incompatibilities with .NET Core, finds known replacements, and generates detailed compatibility assessment reports. This reduces the manual effort involved in modernizing the applications to Linux.

### Porting Assistant Dotnet DataStore
This repository contains the location of data store in S3. The data store contains data files that show package and API compatibility with .NET Core and .NET Standard. 

* Porting assistant uses these data files for finding the compatibility of packages and their APIs.
* For each NuGet package in nuget.org, a separate Json file is defined. Each file captures compatibility information of all its packaged versions.
* It shows compatibility information for all the NuGet packages available in nuget.org - 211k unique packages, 2.5 millions packaged versions (The numbers could change over time).
